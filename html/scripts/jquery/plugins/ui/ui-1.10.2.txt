Version 1.10.2

See: http://jqueryui.com/demos/ for demos and documentation

This distribution of the UI plugin has individual components minified so you can pick and choose
 which to load instead of loading the whole UI core plus other add on javascripts.

 ui.css the common css for all UI javascript - smoothness theme

 ui.all.min.js      : contains core and all other UI javascripts in one file.
                     Use this if you want all functionality in the UI plugin or are not sure.

 ui.core.min.js     : contains only the core js for the UI Plugin including widget, mouse and position plugin bases.
                     Provides this core UI functionality only.
                     You can use this along with other UI files, if you are clear on what functionality you require
                     Eg load ui.core.min as well as ui.dialog.min for dialogs.
