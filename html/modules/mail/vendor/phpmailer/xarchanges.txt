Xarigami Changes

All xarigami changes are marked with XARIGAMI MODIFICATION

PHPMailser 6.5.3

- The below mentioned changes (5.2.28) have not been reproduced
  in this upgrade, to avoid tampering with foreign code for small
  benefit.
  ORIGINAL 6.5.3 is included

PHPMailer 5.2.28

Currently active changes:
- Two ini_set() calls are wrapped with xarFuncIsDisabled
  TODO: check whether this is really needed, if not default in PHPMailer itself.
- Adds an extra "Received:" header with the visitors's IP (or IP forwarded by his Proxy)

Removed previous Xarigami changes:
- Won't modify the "X-Mailer" to add Xarigami
  ---> not so important, less modifications to track
- Won't check PHP version before reading outdated ini_get("safe_mode") setting
  ---> reading it will return FALSE so the code will work fine
