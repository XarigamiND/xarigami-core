Xarigami Changes

PHPMailer 5.2.27
Original release added - will need to reimplement Xarigami changes to the 5.1.

PHPMailer 5.2.9 
Note:
"The autoloader is no longer autoloaded automatically, and the PHPMailer
class does not require the SMTP class explicitly, so you must either load
the autoloader yourself (as all the docs and examples have done for the 
last year), or load the SMTP class yourself. This fixes the inability to
substitute your own SMTP subclass, and also improves interoperability with
other autoloaders."
