Version 1.0.3 - 2007-09-25 jojodee
----------------------------------
Minor change with addition of an extra blockgroup mask

Version 1.0.2 - 2007-06-04 jojodee MAJOR UPGRADE
------------------------------------------------
Block security has changed with all block security controlled from
the blocks module. This has major ramifications for those with security checks
in theme templates, or additional blocks on site with special privileges.

Upgrading: - DenyBlocks privilege is removed (if it exists)
           - a new set of privileges is assigned to Everybody in ReadNonCoreBlocks priv set including:
             View All Base Blocks
             View Authsystem Blocks (login)
             View Theme Blocks
             Deny AdminMenu block
             
1.  You must upgrade your privileges for blocks in your privilege GUI and templates

2.  Module developers no longer need include block or block group instances or masks
    in their module xarinit.php routines as this is handled by the blocks module.

3.  Block developers no longer need include security checks in block code as this is handled
    by the blocks module.
    
4. To create a new privilege in the Privilege Admin GUIfor  a Block (or Blockgroup)
   Choose Blocks as the module,
   Set Block (or Blockgroup) as the component
   Enter the module related to the block, the type and name of the block as requested.

5. To update existing block privileges in the Admin GUI edit the privilege and choose
    - Blocks as the module
    - set block or Blockgroup as the component
    - select the module related to the block, and the type, name as required
    
    No need to change the Name of the privilege when modifying it.

6. Make sure you update any security mask checks in your templates and change them to a
   relevant mask as indicated below:

xarSecurityCheck('EditArticles',0,'Block', '{$title}') would now be

xarSecurityCheck('EditBlock',0,'Block', '{$module}:{$type}:{$name}')

with the instances added (module, type, name) as required.

The full registered block masks are now:
'ViewBlock',    'All', 'blocks', 'Block', 'All:All:All', 'ACCESS_OVERVIEW'
'ReadBlock',    'All', 'blocks', 'Block', 'All:All:All', 'ACCESS_READ'
