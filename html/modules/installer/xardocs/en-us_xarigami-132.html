    <h4>1.3.2 Notes</h4>
    <p>Version 1.3.2 introduces the configurable directory layout previously
         only available in the Cirrus branch.
    </p>
    <p> If you are upgrading please ensure you adjust files as described below prior to running upgrade.php.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Ensure  you <span class="highlight">update your config.system.php file</span>
            with the new directory layout information found in the
            distribution var/config.system.php.dist file.
        </li>
        <li>Please delete all existing core files and replace with the new files as the directory
            structure has changed. The 'includes' directory and 'xaradodb' directory are now moved
            to subdirectories of 'xarigami' and 'adodb' respectively in the new 'lib' directory.
        </li>

        <li>
         The default layout mimics the older directory layout with all key directories under the web root. You can change this layout, including the name of the 'html' folder by editing the defaults in the config.system.php file before or after install or upgrading.
        </li>
    </ol>

        <p>There are no major database changes in this version</p>
