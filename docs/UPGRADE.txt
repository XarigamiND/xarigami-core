PREPARE TO UPGRADE
==================

*   when using the word "replace" or "replacing" in the instructions below we
    mean you must DELETE all old files and copy the new ones in.
    Do not overwrite the old files with the new ones. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

* Always check and compare your custom theme templates against the corresponding core template before you ugprade your site.
  Ensure you have this  'upgraded' theme ready for use with the upgraded site.

1.  Check the VERSION CHANGES at the end of this file and make note of any
    template or site changes you may need to make if you haven't done so
    already

    Before you run upgrade.php, test the upgrade locally if possible on a
    non-production site. Make sure you pay particular attention to changes you
    must make to the specific files or templates at:

    - <xarroot>/var/config.system.php file
    - <xarroot>/var/messages
    - <xarroot>/themes/<yourtheme>

2.  Backup your existing Xarigami or Xaraya installation & database

3.  Log in to your existing Xarigami or Xaraya site with administration rights.

4.  Ensure you backup and protect any custom content or themes you have in:
    - <xarroot>/var/messages
    - <xarroot>/var/ subdirectories (eg uploads, processes etc)
    - <xarroot>/themes/
    - <xarroot>/var/config.system.php

    You can use your backup of these custom files to copy back after you put in
    place the new Xarigami files.

5.  Make a backup of all custom content including themes and other data or image files

6.  Replace all existing Xarigami or Xaraya files, directories, and modules
    with the new Xarigami files EXCEPT:

        - <xarroot>/var/config.system.php

        - custom directories and files below the var directory which may
          contain data from your site (typically uploads, processes etc)

        - your custom themes/<yourtheme> directory

7.  Make a backup (yes, we know this was already mentioned)

    The existing <xarroot>/var/config.system.php must be retained.
    The upgrade script reads database settings from this file.
    However, you should check for any config.system.php.dist file changes
    and update your existing config.system.php file if necessary.

8.  Check permissions and ownership of the new files

9.  Make sure you have cleared all your cache files in
        <xarroot>/var/cache/templates and
        <xarroot>/var/cache/styles  and
        <xarroot>/var/cache/rss

    If you use xarcachemanager, clear your output cache files.

10. In the browser window where you are logged in as administrator,
    point your browser to upgrade.php in your root directory and run this
    script.

    For example, http://www.mywebsite.com/upgrade.php.

    Carefully read and follow the instructions in the upgrade script.

11. Make sure you always run the Site Health Checks at the end of upgrade, and any time you install modules that might be 'older' and not upgrade.

12. After the upgrade has completed, remove or rename install.php
    from your web directory  and ensure that <xarroot>/var/config.system.php
    is read only by your web server.

12. Go to Admin->Modules->View All.
    Upgrade all required modules that are show the status of UPGRADE.
    Remember to Activate them after upgrade if required.
    Run upgrade.php again and the Site Health Checks to ensure any inactive and now active modules are fully upgraded.


Check the COMMON UPGRADE PROBLEMS at the end of this file if you are experiencing upgrade difficulties.

VERSION CHANGES
===============
Please check and update your installation including custom theme templates,
where necessary, before running upgrade.php

1. config.system.php.dist changes between versions
---------------------------------------------------
1.1.3 - cumulus 1.1.5 :  None
1.1.5 - cumulus 1.3.5 :  Operation.Mode, SystemTimeZone, Exception.503 variables


2. Core Template Changes between versions
------------------------------------
Please ensure you use the  Xarigami default Skyone theme for testing.

Always check and compare your custom theme templates against the corresponding core template.
You should use a good diff application and ensure you have any new variables or functionality included in your theme templates.



3. Core DB Changes between versions
----------------------------------------------------
1.1.3 - cumulus 1.1.5 : Privileges have changed for Blocks module.
    The Upgrade process does make provision for this, however
    it is impossible to cater for all privilege situations related to blocks.
    Once upgrade has completed you should revise your privileges for any blocks,
    remove old ineffective privileges and create new ones as necessary.
    (see http://xarigami.com/resources/add_a_privilege_to_deny_a_block_display)

1.1.6   - Privileges for Roles has changed and are now based on UID not name.

        - Theme name can now be different to theme directory. You must have a
          'file friendly' theme name in your theme's xartheme.php file,
           and your site theme name must be placed in the
           'theme' module var called 'default' in your database BEFORE running upgrade.
        - You need to have the 'System Default' theme in your theme directory.

 1.1.6 You must ensure the following BEFORE running upgrade.php:
    a.  Check your theme's xartheme.php info file and make sure the there is a $themeinfo['name']
        variable that in Xarigami should not have spaces or special characters - just like
        a file name. You must also make sure this is the same name that exists in your database
        in the entry for this theme in the theme table.

    b. Check the 'themes' module variable called 'default' with modid 6 (for themes module) in
        your module_vars table. This should also be the name of your site theme,
        as in point 1 above.

1.1.7  The major changes are in the template where sprite usage has been added. If you are missing
       icons in your admin areas then check you have the new core css and sprite css loaded.

1.1.8  Privilege changes for roles to use UID instead of name.
       Masks have been changed so that moderation is now higher than masks for edit level.
       This makes a difference in modules that make use of this such as Xarigami articles.

1.3.0  Changes in core mod vars with both changed and additional module vars.
       Some dynamic data properties have changed and storage in the database.

1.3.3   Added index on theme variables table
        Added new column in theme variables table

1.3.5   Some DD property formats have changed for validation and values. These
        are handled in the upgrade process.

1.4.0   All DD properties have been reworked and the main properties and object classes.
        - Property input and output templates have changed
        - label.xd for label output has changed.
        Make sure you diff any override templates for properties
        - Make sure you var/cache/style directory exists and is writeable.

1.4.1   -

1.5.0	- State tables for modules and themes is removed 
	and state integrated to modules and themes tables respectively

1.5.1	- sessions_info table has changed size of the sess_id and ipaddr columns to cater for hashed sessions and ipv6.

1.5.4   - query upgrade to latest V 1.9.1

1.5.5   - no database changes

Common Upgrade Problems
==========================

*   If you are getting errors after upgrade, clear your template and rss cache
    files. Clear your xarcachemanager output cache if you have this module
    installed.

*   If you are having difficulty accessing a module, check to see if it
    needs upgrading, and also ensure it is activated if required

*   If you are using a default theme, ensure it is active and also
    does not need upgrading.

*   The <xarroot>var/cache/rss and <xarroot>/var/cache/templates directories
    need to be writable and executable
